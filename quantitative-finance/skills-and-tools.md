## The Quant Toolkit: Essential Skills and Tools

**Programming**

- numpy, scipy, pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, multiprocessing, joblib, asyncio

**Mathematics**

- Linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, stochastic calculus, convex optimization

**Statistics**

- Linear regression (OLS), logistic regression, ARIMA, statistical inference (frequentist and Bayesian), PCA, random forest, GBM, XGBoost

**Numerical Methods**

- Monte Carlo, finite differences, numerical integration, stochastic simulations, bootstrap resampling, Kalman/particle filters

**Finance Domain-Specific**

- Option pricing, fixed income, portfolio theory, market microstructure, risk management (market risk and credit risk)

**Project Delivery**

- Jupyter notebooks for analysis and research, LaTeX for project reports, GitHub for your CV. Always produce readable code with comments, docstrings, and a modifiable, abstractable design. Contribute to open-source quant projects if you can.
