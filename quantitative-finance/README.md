# Quant Finance: What to Study and Which Tools to Master

> ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaway**  
> "Quantitative finance isnâ€™t about knowing every equation. Itâ€™s about knowing how to **turn financial intuition into a solvable model**â€”and then having the tools to solve it."

## To Truly Succeed, A Quant Needs To:

- **Know the math** â€“ you don't need a PhD, but you must be fluent in applied probability, optimisation, and linear algebra.
- **Code like a dev** â€“ clean, testable, reusable code. Fast prototyping and analysis. Ability to create production-level code.
- **Think like a researcher** â€“ ask: is this idea significant, robust and valid out-of-sample? What assumptions am I making, what hypothesis am I trying to disprove?
- **Act like a product owner** â€“ turn ideas into tools. Make people use them; team, traders, etc.
- **Communicate with impact** â€“ translate quant findings to stories. Use visuals, concise takeaways, and memorable intuition.

## Why did you write this guide
As a quantitative person with an entrepreneurial spirit, I have always admired quant researchers that have made their work available to others, being generous with their time and knowledge.
Two individuals who have contributed in a big way to the quant community are Emmanuel Derman and Paul Wilmott who co-authored the Financial Modelers' Manifesto, a proposal for increased responsibility in financial modeling and risk management.

In a similiar way to the impact that [The Financial Modelersâ€™ Manifesto](https://wilmott.com/financial-modelers-manifesto/) has for anyone using models in their career, on a smaller scale I wanted to create a positive impact for the small number of individuals who have the drive, intellect and energy to overcome hurdles and pursue a successful career in their 20-30s.
Hopefully this manifesto can act as a guide and reference for motivated individuals navigating their early career decisions in pursuit of a long and rewarding career in quant finance.
