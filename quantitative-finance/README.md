# Quant Finance: What to Study and Which Tools to Master

> 💡 **Key Takeaway**  
> "Quantitative finance isn’t about knowing every equation. It’s about knowing how to **turn financial intuition into a solvable model**—and then having the tools to solve it."

## To Truly Succeed, A Quant Needs To:

- **Know the math** – you don't need a PhD, but you must be fluent in applied probability, optimisation, and linear algebra.
- **Code like a dev** – clean, testable, reusable code. Fast prototyping and analysis. Ability to create production-level code.
- **Think like a researcher** – ask: is this idea significant, robust and valid out-of-sample? What assumptions am I making, what hypothesis am I trying to disprove?
- **Act like a product owner** – turn ideas into tools. Make people use them; team, traders, etc.
- **Communicate with impact** – translate quant findings to stories. Use visuals, concise takeaways, and memorable intuition.
