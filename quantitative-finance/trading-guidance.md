# Trading Guidance

Trading is fundamentally an exercise in **managing ignorance**.  
No one has perfect knowledge of markets, and the edge comes from **risk management, discipline, and probabilistic thinking**.

## 1. Core Principles
- **Uncertainty is the norm** – Markets are complex adaptive systems. Accept that you will never know everything.  
- **Survival first** – Protect capital before chasing profits.  
- **Asymmetry matters** – Seek situations where the potential upside outweighs the downside.  

---

## 2. Risk Management
- **Position sizing**: Never bet so big that one trade can wipe you out.  
- **Stop losses & exits**: Predefine how you’ll get out before you enter.  
- **Diversification**: Avoid concentration risk; one position should never decide your future.
- **Kelly Criterion (Optional)** – Size positions based on expected edge and variance.

## 3. Probabilistic Thinking
Trading is a game of **probabilities, not certainties**. The goal is not to be right every time, but to consistently make decisions with positive expectancy.  

- **Think in distributions, not certainties** – Each trade is a probability bet, not a guaranteed outcome.  
- **Law of Large Numbers** – Focus on long-term expectancy, not individual wins or losses.  
- **Second-Order Effects** – Consider not just what happens if you’re right, but also the consequences if you’re wrong.  

### Practical Tools
- **Expected Value (EV)**  
  \[
  EV = (Probability\ of\ Win × Average\ Win) - (Probability\ of\ Loss × Average\ Loss)
  \]  
  Trade only when EV is positive.  

- **Asymmetry**  
  Favor setups where potential gain far outweighs potential loss (e.g., 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio).  

- **Scenario Analysis**  
  Map out multiple outcomes (bullish, bearish, sideways) and their likelihoods before entering a trade.  

## 4. Data-Driven Trading Process
- **Hypothesis → Test → Refine**  
  Treat strategies like scientific experiments.  
  - Define hypothesis: *“Momentum signals in large-cap tech outperform in trending markets.”*  
  - Backtest with historical data.  
  - Evaluate results: Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, win rate, expectancy.  

- **Key Metrics**  
  - Sharpe / Sortino Ratios – Return relative to risk.  
  - Max Drawdown – How much you can lose in worst case.  
  - Win Rate vs. Payoff Ratio – High win rate is meaningless if losses are huge.  
  - Trade Expectancy – Long-run profitability of strategy.  

- **Continuous Feedback**  
  Keep a *data journal* with metrics, not just emotions.  
  Refine edges based on what works empirically, not intuition alone.

## 5. Decision-Making Frameworks
- **OODA Loop (Boyd)** – Observe → Orient → Decide → Act. Fast iteration wins.  
- **Pre-Mortem** – Before entering a trade, ask: *“If this loses, what went wrong?”*  
- **Checklists** – Reduce emotional errors by having predefined rules before every trade.  

---

## 6. Psychological Anchors
- **Process > Outcome** – Judge decisions by reasoning, not by short-term results.  
- **Ego Management** – Markets punish arrogance; humility is a survival trait.  
- **Patience** – Waiting for high-quality setups is often the edge.  

---

## 7. Practical Habits
- **Trading Journal** – Record: thesis, entry, exit, P&L, metrics.  
- **Regular Review** – Analyze losers more than winners.  
- **Automation Where Possible** – Use systematic signals to reduce emotional interference.

# Final Note
The best traders are not fortune tellers.  
Trading is not about predicting the future.  
They are **risk managers** with a **repeatable, data-driven process** who aim to be *vaguely right* more often than *very wrong*.  
It’s about managing your **ignorance**, controlling your **risk**, and putting yourself in a position where being *vaguely right* still allows you to win.  
Consistency, humility, and discipline are the compounding assets of a trading career.
