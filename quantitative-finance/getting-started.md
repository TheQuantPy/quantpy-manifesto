## Quant Finance Learning – The Most Important Book

- **Paul Wilmott Introduces Quantitative Finance, 2nd Edition**

This is the single best book to start with. Read it cover to cover.

If you are currently studying a quantitative finance program I would further recommend **Paul Wilmott on Quantitative Finance** 3 volume series. _Note the first volume is the introduction book mentioned above_.

## Final Learning Advice

1. Start with Wilmott’s book and basic Python.
2. Work through the interview books and online resources.
3. Learn statistics and portfolio optimization.
4. Practice coding and implementing models in Python.
5. Use Stack Exchange and GitHub to find answers and code examples.
6. Don’t just read—build, code, and experiment.

## Closing Thoughts

Don't start anything from scratch, complete a literature review (however brief) and build on the solutions of others who have come before you!

- If you need to value vanilla/complex derivaties, use [QuantLib](https://www.quantlib.org/)
- If you want to perform portfolio optimisation, start with [Riskfolio-Lib](https://github.com/dcajasn/Riskfolio-Lib/tree/master)
- If you are looking to integrate machine learning into your financial analysis, build on [mlfinlab](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab)
- QuantStats Python library that performs portfolio profiling, allowing quants and portfolio managers to understand their performance better by providing them with in-depth analytics and risk metrics. [QuantStats](https://github.com/ranaroussi/quantstats)

## If you do the above, you’ll be in a much stronger position to succeed in quant finance.
