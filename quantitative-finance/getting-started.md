## Quant Finance Learning – The Most Important Book

- **Paul Wilmott Introduces Quantitative Finance, 2nd Edition**

This is the single best book to start with. Read it cover to cover.

If you are currently studying a quantitative finance program I would further recommend **Paul Wilmott on Quantitative Finance** 3 volume series. _Note the first volume is the introduction book mentioned above_.

## Statistics

- _Statistical Quantitative Methods in Finance: From Theory to Quantitative Portfolio Management_ by Samit Ahlawat
- _Quantitative Methods in Finance_ by Eric Vansteenberghe ([SSRN](https://ssrn.com/abstract=5178205) or [DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5178205))
- _Statistical Analysis of Financial Data in R_ by Rene Carmona
- _Modern Statistics: A Computer-Based Approach with Python_
- _The Elements of Statistical Learning_ (Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman)
- _Theory of Statistics_ by Mark J. Schervish

## Programming

#### Becoming Great at Python (a popular weapon of the quantitative researcher)

- If you don’t know Python at all, start with [JP Morgan Python Training](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/python-training/tree/main)
- Then do an introductory book like: [Python For Finance Cookbook](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Python-for-Finance-Cookbook/tree/master)
- _Advanced Python Programming_ (Packt)
- Be a better software engineer: Arjan Codes [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArjanCodes)

## Final Learning Advice

1. Start with Wilmott’s book and basic Python.
2. Work through the interview books and online resources.
3. Learn statistics and portfolio optimization.
4. Practice coding and implementing models in Python.
5. Use Stack Exchange and GitHub to find answers and code examples.
6. Don’t just read—build, code, and experiment.

## Closing Thoughts

Read [_The Financial Modeler's Manifesto_](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1324878), then read it again! If you are reading this github repository, you will likely be using models your entire working life, hold onto these recommendations and please follow them.

Don't start anything from scratch, complete a literature review (however brief) and build on the solutions of others who have come before you!

- If you need to value vanilla/complex derivaties, use [QuantLib](https://www.quantlib.org/)
- If you want to perform portfolio optimisation, start with [Riskfolio-Lib](https://github.com/dcajasn/Riskfolio-Lib/tree/master)
- If you are looking to integrate machine learning into your financial analysis, build on [mlfinlab](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab)
- If you want to calculate portfolio performance and risk metrics from backtest or live data, use [QuantStats](https://github.com/ranaroussi/quantstats)

## If you do the above, you’ll be in a much stronger position to succeed in quant finance.
