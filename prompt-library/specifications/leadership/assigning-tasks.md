## ✉️ Communication: Assigning Tasks via Email/Written Form

Effective written delegation increases clarity, speed, and trust. Use a consistent structure and a curious, question-driven style to align and unblock.

### Principles
- Lead with context, then goal, then tasks.
- Explain the “why” to enable good judgment and autonomy.
- Write for the audience: level, background, and bandwidth.
- Be flexible on output format; extend trust while defining outcomes.
- Make tasks outcome-driven and time-bound; document decisions.

### Structure: Context → Goal → Tasks
1. Context  
   - What’s happening, constraints, dependencies, definitions.
   - Why this matters now; how success will be used.
2. Goal (Outcome)  
   - Single, clear objective; measurable if possible.
   - Non-goals to prevent scope creep.
3. Tasks (with Ownership and Timeline)  
   - Break down into steps; specify deliverables and due dates.
   - Link resources, prior work, examples, and standards.
   - Call to action: “Please read this fully and confirm understanding.”
4. Communication Plan  
   - Checkpoints (dates), update cadence, and decision owners.
   - Risks/assumptions to track and what to do if they change.

### Template (copy/paste)
Subject: [Project/Task]: Context, Goal, Tasks, Timeline

Hi <Name>,

Context  
- <1–3 bullets with key background, constraints, stakeholders>  
- Why now: <impact/priority>

Goal (Outcome)  
- <One sentence outcome + success criteria>  
- Non-goals: <optional bullets>

Tasks & Deliverables  
- <Owner>: <Task> → Deliverable by <Date>  
- <Owner>: <Task> → Deliverable by <Date>  
Resources  
- <Links to docs, examples, standards, prior art>

Communication Plan  
- Updates: <cadence> | Checkpoint(s): <date(s)> | Decision owner: <name>  
Please read this fully and reply to confirm understanding, risks, and any tradeoffs you propose.

Thanks,  
<You>

### Question-Driven Course Correction
When work deviates, guide with curiosity first; then realign to best practice.

- Start with understanding:
  - “Can you share your reasoning for choosing X over Y?”
  - “What constraints or assumptions led you there?”
  - “How are you measuring success against the stated goal?”
- Bridge to direction:
  - “Have you considered <approach> for consistency with <link to prior work>?”
  - “Best practice in our stack is <standard>; let’s align to it here.”
  - “Given <constraint>, let’s pivot to <new plan>. Does anything block that?”
- Close with clarity:
  - “Updated deliverable: <outcome> by <date>.”
  - “Please confirm and flag any risks by <time>.”

### Best Practices Checklist
- Outcome first; tasks serve the outcome.
- Specify owners, timelines, and done criteria.
- Link examples and standards to reduce ambiguity.
- Invite tradeoffs: “If scope/time conflict, propose options.”
- Keep tone respectful and curious; assume positive intent.
- Summarize decisions and next steps after every checkpoint.

### Quick Dos and Don’ts
- Do: “Why now” + “Definition of done” + “Next checkpoint.”  
- Do: Ask clarifying questions before prescribing solutions.  
- Don’t: Over-specify implementation when intent suffices.  
- Don’t: Change scope without updating goal/timeline in writing.
