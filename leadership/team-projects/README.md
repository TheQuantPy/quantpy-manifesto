# Team Projects

People are often the solution you have been missing.

As someone with a chemical engineering undergraduate, I tend to immediately want to start solving hard problems myself. However somewhere along the way, I realised that it is much more powerful to leverage amazing individuals, who are driven and have aligned interests to work on the same problem you are working on.

By 'aligning others' and doing this in a genuine way, this can lead to great leverage. The old adage, two minds are better than one definitely comes to mind here.

You can achieve this genuinely by actually caring about the individuals - asking, listening and helping the individual pursue their dream goals, skills, or career direction they want to advance. This is the key, to actually care about the development of individuals.

And yes, this means that they may 'out-grow' your team, or eventually gain the skills to move elsewhere. That's the amazing thing, helping individuals move in the direction they want to go! Don't hold them back.

### Hard conversations and course correction

Handy framework from Alex H.:

1. What - Were they unaware, possible communication issue?
2. How - Don't know how, training may be needed?
3. When - was there a deadline associated with the task?
4. Motivation - are they not incentivized?

Blocking -> sometimes you could have all 4 not be issues, but there may be another blcoker. Solve and remove impediment immediately.

### Helpful resources

There are some specficiation md files, to help frame project specfications, requirements and also for assigning tasks to individuals.
