## One-Touch Principle (Time & Decision Management)

**Core Idea:** Handle each decision or task once: _Do it, Delegate it, or Delete it_.

**Why It Works:** Builds decisiveness, prevents bottlenecks, and signals respect for peopleâ€™s time.

**Use Case:** Great for **scaling leadership** and keeping teams moving fast.
