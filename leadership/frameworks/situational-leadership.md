## Situational Leadership (Hersey-Blanchard)

**Core Idea:** Leaders adapt their style depending on the maturity and skill level of the team member.

**Styles:**

- **Directing** – High guidance, low support (good for juniors).
- **Coaching** – High guidance, high support (developing talent).
- **Supporting** – Low guidance, high support (capable but unconfident).
- **Delegating** – Low guidance, low support (empowered experts).

**Use Case:** Helps you **meet people where they are**, avoiding micromanagement or neglect.
