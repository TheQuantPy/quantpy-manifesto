## First Principles + Execution Flywheel

**Core Idea:** Great leaders break complex challenges into fundamentals, then create a feedback loop of execution and learning.

**Steps:**

1. Clarify the _first principles_ (mission, goals, constraints).
2. Align the team around clear outcomes.
3. Execute quickly.
4. Measure outcomes (data + feedback).
5. Adapt, improve, repeat.

**Use Case:** Keeps teams **aligned, fast, and improving continuously**.
