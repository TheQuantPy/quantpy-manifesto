# Advice to my younger self

During the time that I was actively posting on the QuantPy YouTube channel, I would often receive messages through LinkedIn or email asking for advice on 1. how to trade profitably, 2. how to 'get into quant finance'. After having had many conversations with young ambitious individuals since, I believe both of these questions groups come from the same place.

In fact, this is the same place I was in when I was 18 years old. I was young, bright, hungry and wanted to be successful. Comparing success against the circles I was exposed to, this meant professional success - Money!

Therefore in an effort to help others who are in the same impressionable stage of their lives, I want to reflect on my own experiences from 20-30s. I want to reflect on my life experiences, what I've achieved, what I struggled with, the decisions I made and my beliefs now and where I'm going.

I hope that this advice, although tailored mostly now for my two sons Leonardo and Tommaso, will guide other interested anad ambitious individuals who want to be rewarded financially by 'doing the work' that makes hours pass like minutes!
