# Problem-Solving Frameworks

This document outlines three powerful problem-solving frameworks that can be applied in different contexts:

1. First Principles Thinking
2. OODA Loop
3. DMAIC

## How the Frameworks Map to Thinking Styles

### OODA Loop → Fast Thinking (System 1 guided by System 2)

- Operations (trading desks, crisis management, live production lines) require speed.
- OODA works because it prioritizes quick cycles of action and feedback.
- Intuition and rapid judgment (System 1) dominate, but periodic reorientation (System 2) prevents drift.

### First Principles → Slow Thinking (System 2 heavy)

- Design, innovation, or strategy problems need deep reasoning.
- Breaking down assumptions and rebuilding from fundamentals is deliberate, analytical, and slow.
- System 2 is central, but System 1 can help generate creative leaps once the groundwork is laid.

### DMAIC → Structured Slow Thinking (System 2 formalized)

- Continuous improvement, process design, and risk management benefit from rigor and discipline.
- DMAIC forces a methodical, data-driven approach — essentially codifying System 2 thinking into steps.
- System 1 can contribute by spotting patterns or anomalies quickly during “Measure” or “Analyze.”

## Operational Insight

- **Operations Teams**: Benefit from OODA + Fast Thinking because real-time adaptability is crucial.
- **Design & Strategy Teams**: Benefit from First Principles + DMAIC + Slow Thinking because they are building systems, structures, or products that require depth, accuracy, and long-term robustness.

## Integrated Approach

You can think of this as **time-scale matching**:

- **Short-cycle problems (minutes to hours):** Favor OODA with System 1 dominance.
- **Medium-cycle problems (weeks to months):** Favor DMAIC with System 2 structure.
- **Long-cycle problems (months to years):** Favor First Principles with System 2 exploration.
