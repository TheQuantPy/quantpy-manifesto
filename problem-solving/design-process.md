# Musk’s 5-Step Design Process

> “Your requirements are definitely dumb, it does not matter who gave them to you.” — Elon Musk

This process was revealed by Elon Musk in an interview (Everyday Astronaut, 2021) when asked about the design of SpaceX’s grid fins. Musk explained that SpaceX follows a **five-step design process**, applied rigorously, to rethink how rockets are built, launched, and iterated upon.

While born from aerospace engineering, this framework can be applied to **any design or innovation process**: product development, UX design, marketing campaigns, or even business strategy.

## **The 5 Steps**

### 1. Make the Requirements Less Dumb

- Every requirement should be questioned.
- Don’t assume validity just because a “smart person” proposed it.
- Requirements must be **owned by a person, not a department** — this ensures accountability and prevents zombie rules from persisting.
- Similar to “question the question” in Framestorming.

---

### 2. Delete the Part or Process

- “If you’re not adding things back in at least 10% of the time, you’re clearly not deleting enough.”
- Default bias should be **remove first, justify later**.
- Avoid the “just in case” mindset — nearly anything can be rationalized this way.
- Keep only what is essential.

---

### 3. Simplify or Optimise the Design

- Optimisation should come **only after** removing unnecessary requirements.
- Avoid the trap of optimising what shouldn’t exist.
- Engineers must look at the system **holistically** (e.g., don’t optimise the engine weight if payload remains inefficient).
- Prioritise **first principles thinking**: reduce to fundamentals, then rebuild.

---

### 4. Accelerate Cycle Time

- Move faster, but ensure you’re moving in the **right direction**.
- Speed without prior steps = wasted effort (“if you’re digging your grave, don’t dig faster”).
- Lean into Agile principles: iterate quickly, test, learn, adjust.
- Aim for rapid **learning loops**, not just raw speed.

---

### 5. Automate

- Automate **last**, not first.
- Do not optimise or automate broken processes.
- Example: Tesla Model 3 — a robotic process for battery mats was automated, only to later discover the mats were unnecessary.
- **Lesson**: question whether a process is required before investing in automation.

---

## **Origins**

- Revealed by Elon Musk in an interview with _Everyday Astronaut_.
- Emerged from SpaceX’s pursuit of building rockets differently from traditional aerospace approaches.
- Practical application: the design of the Falcon rocket grid fins (decision not to fold them).

## **In Your Latticework**

Musk’s process extends beyond rocket engineering:

- **First Principles Thinking** → strip problems down to basics.
- **Framestorming** → question the question itself.
- **Occam’s Razor** → simplest solution is often best.
- **Lean Startup / MVP** → focus on building “good enough” (Musk’s “Minimum Viable Rocket”).
- Counters the tendency toward redundancy and feature creep.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- Requirements are assumptions until tested.
- Delete before you optimise.
- Simplify before you accelerate.
- Accelerate before you automate.
- Always design with accountability and intent.
