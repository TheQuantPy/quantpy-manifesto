# Fast vs. Slow Thinking in Problem Solving

### System 1 (Fast Thinking)

- Intuitive, rapid, heuristic-based.
- Useful in environments where speed and adaptability matter more than perfect accuracy.
- Risk: can be biased or overly simplistic.

### System 2 (Slow Thinking)

- Deliberate, analytical, structured.
- Useful in design, planning, or solving complex, novel problems.
- Risk: can be too slow for dynamic situations.
