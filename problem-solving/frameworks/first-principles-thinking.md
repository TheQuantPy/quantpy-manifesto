## First Principles Thinking

A bottom-up approach focused on reducing problems to their fundamental truths and reconstructing solutions from there.

### Steps

1. **Clarify the Problem** – Define the problem as precisely as possible.
2. **Break It Down** – Reduce the problem into basic truths or constraints.
3. **Rebuild From the Ground Up** – Develop solutions from these fundamentals rather than by analogy.
4. **Test and Iterate** – Validate assumptions and refine through experiments or simulations.

### Best Used For

- Innovation and design problems.
- Novel or complex challenges where conventional wisdom may be limiting.
