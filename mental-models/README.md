# Mental Frameworks for Problem Solving & Life

A curated set of mental models and problem-solving frameworks to help you think more clearly, make better decisions, and approach life with structure.

## 1. Alex Hormozi’s 3-Part Lens

- **Logic** – What does it mean?  
  Break down the statement or problem into its most literal form.
- **Evidence** – How do you know?  
  Seek objective proof or data supporting (or contradicting) the idea.
- **Utility** – Why does it matter?  
  Assess whether this actually impacts your goals or decisions.

## 2. Charlie Munger: _Invert, Always Invert_

- Instead of asking: _“How can I succeed?”_
- Ask: _“What would cause me to fail?”_  
  By identifying failure paths, you often uncover the most effective steps toward success.

## 3. First Principles Thinking (Elon Musk’s favorite)

- Break a problem down to its **fundamental truths**.
- Rebuild reasoning from the ground up instead of relying on analogies or convention.
- Example: Instead of “batteries are expensive,” ask: _“What are the raw materials? What are their costs? Can we design a cheaper way?”_

## 4. OODA Loop (Military Strategy → Decision Making)

Developed by U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd:

1. **Observe** – Gather current information.
2. **Orient** – Analyze and put it in context.
3. **Decide** – Choose the best course of action.
4. **Act** – Execute quickly.  
   Then repeat. The faster you cycle through OODA, the greater your advantage.

## 5. Eisenhower Matrix (Time & Priority Management)

Helps prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance:

|                   | **Urgent**  | **Not Urgent** |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| **Important**     | Do it now   | Schedule it    |
| **Not Important** | Delegate it | Eliminate it   |

This prevents wasting time on things that don’t matter.

## 6. Second-Order Thinking

- Don’t just think about the **immediate effect**.
- Ask: _“And then what?”_
- Example: Eating fast food saves time (first-order), but leads to health problems (second-order). Long-term thinkers apply this filter to avoid costly mistakes.

# Closing Note

These frameworks are not rules but lenses. The more you practice switching between them, the clearer your thinking becomes.
