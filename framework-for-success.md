# Letter from Trevor Heath – April 8, 2018

## Some thoughts for the future: JRE  

Soon after we met in 2014 I realised that you have **intellectual, practical, personal (and sporting) abilities of the highest order**, and the potential to combine these to make a real difference.  

This letter is my attempt to help you to convert that potential into a life that will bring you satisfaction, reward, pride and happiness.  

I hope that you will direct your efforts towards improving your world in some way. As this is such a broad scope, it will be necessary to establish and focus on priorities to avoid spreading your talents too thinly.

## While working towards your objectives, I hope too that you will:  

a) **always seek to work with smarter people, in the ‘best’ place;**  
b) **maintain a healthy balance** in your life, and in attitudes/relationships to others and the world generally;  
c) **convince yourself that doing your best is a more rewarding objective than striving to BE the best;**  
d) maintain the enthusiasm, curiosity, optimism, thoughtfulness, forward thinking, self-confidence, ego and ambition that have been such an impressive and engaging feature of your younger life, but  
e) temper these qualities with:  

- regular infusions of humility;  
- rigorous self-analysis and self-criticism;  
- willingness to accept and act on constructive feedback from others;  
- avoidance of overt self-promotion both direct and indirect;  
- positive efforts to avoid showing irritation/intolerance to others.

## I believe that the extent to which you will be able to achieve your objectives will depend in large part on how well you are able to:  

a) **maintain your integrity:** be seen as impeccably truthful, trustworthy, honest, reliable and responsible, all of which go to maintaining the good name/reputation without which all else is doomed;  

b) **be credible:** others may use exaggerations and inaccuracies as a reason to question the veracity of all output;  

c) ensure, to the extent possible, when embarking on something new, that you pay particular attention to:  

- where in a hierarchy you work most effectively. Some people are most effective as figureheads, taking public responsibility, whereas others (including me!!) work best with direct control over outcomes;  
- maximising the value of your strengths, including intellect, curiosity, flexibility, enthusiasm,  
- minimising the effects of areas of vulnerability, such as social isolation, tolerance for ambiguity, impatience with some others.  

d) **see situations involving other people from their point of view, reflecting on (depending on the situation):**  

- what led them to the current position?  
- are they being altruistic, or what’s in it for them?  

*(note; If self-interest is in the race, back it every time)*  

- what is involved for them; is this, embarrassing, intrusive?  
- be judicious in verbal output; reflect on why they need to know that.  

---

While nobody can offer guarantees of success, whatever that means to you at the time, I hope that these pointers will provide a framework that will support you as you move towards achieving your objectives.  

I will be very keen to do anything (else) that I can to help you along that journey.
