# Letter from Trevor Heath – April 7, 2018

Some thoughts for the future: JRE 

Soon after we met back in 2014 I realised that you have intellectual, practical, personal (and sporting) abilities of the highest order, and the potential to combine these to make a real difference.  This letter is my attempt to help you to convert that potential into a life that will bring you satisfaction, reward, pride and happiness. 
I hope that you will direct your efforts towards improving your world in some way. As this is such a broad scope, it will be necessary to establish and focus on priorities to avoid spreading your talents too thinly. 
While working towards your objectives, I hope too that you will: 
   a) convince yourself that doing your best is a more rewarding objective than striving to BE the best; 
   
   b) maintain the enthusiasm, curiosity, optimism, thoughtfulness, forward thinking, self-confidence, ego  and ambition that have been such an impressive and engaging feature of your younger life, but 
   
   c) temper these qualities with:   
   
      a. regular infusions of  humility,   
      
      b. rigorous self-analysis and self-criticism   
      
      c. a willingness to accept and act on constructive feedback from others. 
      
      d. avoidance of  overt self-promotion both direct and indirect   
      
I believe that the extent to which you will be able to achieve your objectives will depend in large part on how well you are able to:   
   a) maintain your integrity: be seen as impeccably truthful, trustworthy, honest, reliable and responsible, all of which go to maintaining the  good name/reputation without which all else is doomed; 
   
   b) be credible: others may use exaggerations and inaccuracies as a reason to question the veracity of all output;   
   
   c) see situations involving other people from their point of view, reflecting on (depending on the situation): 
   
      a. what led them to the current position? 
      
      b. are they being altruistic, or what’s in it for them (note; If self-interest is in the race, back it every time)   
      
      c. what is involved for them; is this interaction inconvenient, embarrassing, intrusive? 
      
      d. be judicious in verbal output, first reflecting on why that person needs to know that  info. 
      
   d) ensure, to the extent possible, when embarking on something new, that you pay particular attention to: 
   
      a. where in a hierarchy you work most effectively. Some people are most effective as figureheads, taking public responsibility, whereas others (including me!!) work best with direct control over outcomes; where do you fit?   
      
      b. maximising the value of your strengths, including intellect, curiosity, flexibility, enthusiasm,   
      
      c. minimising the effects of areas of vulnerability, such as social isolation, tolerance for ambiguity, impatience with some others. 
      
While nobody can offer guarantees of success, whatever that means to you at the time, I hope that these pointers will provide a framework that will support you as you move towards achieving your objectives. I will be very keen to do anything (else) that I can to help you along that journey.
