# Protocol for a Better Life  

This letter was written to me on April 7, 2018, by my dear friend and trusted mentor, **Emeritus Professor Trevor Heath OAM**.  

It was shared with the explicit aim of helping me reflect on what I should focus on, and importantly, what I should be aware of in order to achieve success. Trevor’s guidance represents not only wisdom born of experience, but also a deeply personal investment in my growth as a person and professional.  

I have included this letter in these collections because, although it was written as a personal letter with personalised advice, I believe that for those who are bright individuals at the start of their journey to success — in whatever form that success looks like to them — there may be lessons here worth reflecting on.  

The letter stands as a framework — not prescriptive, but reflective — encouraging humility, balance, and integrity while pursuing meaningful ambitions. I share it here both as a personal reminder and in the hope that others might also find inspiration in Trevor’s words.

## Some thoughts for the future: JRE  

Soon after we met in 2014 I realised that you have intellectual, practical, personal (and sporting) abilities of the highest order, and the potential to combine these to make a real difference.  

This letter is my attempt to help you to convert that potential into a life that will bring you satisfaction, reward, pride and happiness.  

I hope that you will direct your efforts towards improving your world in some way. As this is such a broad scope, it will be necessary to establish and focus on priorities to avoid spreading your talents too thinly.

## While working towards your objectives, I hope too that you will:  

a) always seek to work with smarter people, in the ‘best’ place;  
b) maintain a healthy balance in your life, and in attitudes/relationships to others and the world generally;  
c) convince yourself that doing your best is a more rewarding objective than striving to BE the best;  
d) maintain the enthusiasm, curiosity, optimism, thoughtfulness, forward thinking, self-confidence, ego and ambition that have been such an impressive and engaging feature of your younger life, but  
e) temper these qualities with:  

- regular infusions of humility;  
- rigorous self-analysis and self-criticism;  
- willingness to accept and act on constructive feedback from others;  
- avoidance of overt self-promotion both direct and indirect;  
- positive efforts to avoid showing irritation/intolerance to others.

## I believe that the extent to which you will be able to achieve your objectives will depend in large part on how well you are able to:  

a) maintain your integrity: be seen as impeccably truthful, trustworthy, honest, reliable and responsible, all of which go to maintaining the good name/reputation without which all else is doomed;  

b) be credible: others may use exaggerations and inaccuracies as a reason to question the veracity of all output;  

c) ensure, to the extent possible, when embarking on something new, that you pay particular attention to:  

- where in a hierarchy you work most effectively. Some people are most effective as figureheads, taking public responsibility, whereas others (including me!!) work best with direct control over outcomes;  
- maximising the value of your strengths, including intellect, curiosity, flexibility, enthusiasm,  
- minimising the effects of areas of vulnerability, such as social isolation, tolerance for ambiguity, impatience with some others.  

d) see situations involving other people from their point of view, reflecting on (depending on the situation):  

- what led them to the current position?  
- are they being altruistic, or what’s in it for them?  

(note; If self-interest is in the race, back it every time)  

- what is involved for them; is this, embarrassing, intrusive?  
- be judicious in verbal output; reflect on why they need to know that.

While nobody can offer guarantees of success, whatever that means to you at the time, I hope that these pointers will provide a framework that will support you as you move towards achieving your objectives.  

I will be very keen to do anything (else) that I can to help you along that journey.
