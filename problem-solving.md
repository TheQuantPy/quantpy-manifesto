# Problem-Solving Frameworks

This document outlines three powerful problem-solving frameworks that can be applied in different contexts:  
1. First Principles Thinking  
2. OODA Loop  
3. DMAIC  

---

## 1. First Principles Thinking  
A bottom-up approach focused on reducing problems to their fundamental truths and reconstructing solutions from there.  

### Steps  
1. **Clarify the Problem** – Define the problem as precisely as possible.  
2. **Break It Down** – Reduce the problem into basic truths or constraints.  
3. **Rebuild From the Ground Up** – Develop solutions from these fundamentals rather than by analogy.  
4. **Test and Iterate** – Validate assumptions and refine through experiments or simulations.  

### Best Used For  
- Innovation and design problems.  
- Novel or complex challenges where conventional wisdom may be limiting.  

---

## 2. OODA Loop  
A decision-making cycle designed for speed and adaptability in dynamic environments.  

### Steps  
1. **Observe** – Gather data and facts about the situation.  
2. **Orient** – Interpret the data, taking into account context, biases, and models.  
3. **Decide** – Choose a course of action based on available knowledge.  
4. **Act** – Execute the decision and feed outcomes back into the loop.  

### Best Used For  
- Operations and execution environments.  
- Situations requiring rapid responses to change or uncertainty.

## 3. DMAIC (Six Sigma)  
A structured, data-driven approach for process improvement and problem-solving.  

### Steps  
1. **Define** – Clearly articulate the problem, scope, and goals.  
2. **Measure** – Collect data to establish the current state and baseline.  
3. **Analyze** – Identify root causes of inefficiencies or issues.  
4. **Improve** – Develop, test, and implement solutions.  
5. **Control** – Standardize improvements and monitor to sustain results.  

### Best Used For  
- Continuous improvement in operations and processes.  
- Problems where rigor, discipline, and measurable outcomes are required.

# Fast vs. Slow Thinking in Problem Solving

## Recap  

### System 1 (Fast Thinking)  
- Intuitive, rapid, heuristic-based.  
- Useful in environments where speed and adaptability matter more than perfect accuracy.  
- Risk: can be biased or overly simplistic.  

### System 2 (Slow Thinking)  
- Deliberate, analytical, structured.  
- Useful in design, planning, or solving complex, novel problems.  
- Risk: can be too slow for dynamic situations.

## How the Frameworks Map to Thinking Styles  

### OODA Loop → Fast Thinking (System 1 guided by System 2)  
- Operations (trading desks, crisis management, live production lines) require speed.  
- OODA works because it prioritizes quick cycles of action and feedback.  
- Intuition and rapid judgment (System 1) dominate, but periodic reorientation (System 2) prevents drift.  

### First Principles → Slow Thinking (System 2 heavy)  
- Design, innovation, or strategy problems need deep reasoning.  
- Breaking down assumptions and rebuilding from fundamentals is deliberate, analytical, and slow.  
- System 2 is central, but System 1 can help generate creative leaps once the groundwork is laid.  

### DMAIC → Structured Slow Thinking (System 2 formalized)  
- Continuous improvement, process design, and risk management benefit from rigor and discipline.  
- DMAIC forces a methodical, data-driven approach — essentially codifying System 2 thinking into steps.  
- System 1 can contribute by spotting patterns or anomalies quickly during “Measure” or “Analyze.”

## Operational Insight  

- **Operations Teams**: Benefit from OODA + Fast Thinking because real-time adaptability is crucial.  
- **Design & Strategy Teams**: Benefit from First Principles + DMAIC + Slow Thinking because they are building systems, structures, or products that require depth, accuracy, and long-term robustness.

## Integrated Approach  

You can think of this as **time-scale matching**:  

- **Short-cycle problems (minutes to hours):** Favor OODA with System 1 dominance.  
- **Medium-cycle problems (weeks to months):** Favor DMAIC with System 2 structure.  
- **Long-cycle problems (months to years):** Favor First Principles with System 2 exploration.
